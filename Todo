Create an asset manager?
Mark materials as shared in order to batch draw calls
	We don't need to change textures for every object that shares a textures

Move matrices maths to the shader so we don't need to do it CPU side
Cache more stuff in Materials

Implement physics ray-casting and triangle intersections
Figure out how to draw to a texture
	Refer to attempt at portfolio project for texture redrawing?


Per transformation matrix component caching
	No need to recreate the rotation matrix if the rotation hasn't changed

Create a dirty proxy to make marking components as dirty easier
